Beginning on the left side of the screenshot we can see gene LOC119422963. 
At the very beginning of this gene there are two exons known as XM_037690411.1-1 and XM_037690411.1-2. 
However, both of these exons are not being expressed in either the larval stage or the diapause stage. 
We know this because there are no peaks in the RNA-Seq for each developmental stage. 
Further downstream in the gene there are ATAC-Seq peaks which tells us that this is a open chromatin region. 
This open chromatin region is non coding, so this means that it contains regulatory sequences such as promoters and enhancers. 
The open chromatin region is expressed in both developmental stages which explains the gene expression shown downstream of the open chromatin region. 
Meanwhile on the right side of the screenshot we can see gene srfb. 
However, unlike LOC119422963 this is the end of srfb. 
So the exon XM_037678055.1-7 is at the very end of the gene. 
This exon is being expressed in both developmental stages which is confirmed by the peaks shown in the RNA-seq.
